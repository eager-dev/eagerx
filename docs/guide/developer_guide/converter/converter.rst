Converter
=========

We do not yet have a dedicated developer guide for :mod:`~eagerx.core.entities.Converter`.
Though, we would like to point out that the API is the same as to the one from :mod:`~eagerx.core.entities.SpaceConverter`,
except that it is not required to define the :func:`~eagerx.core.entities.SpaceConverter.space` method.

For an example, see :ref:`here <space_converter_guide>`.
