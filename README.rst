What is EAGERx
==============
EAGERx (Engine Agnostic Gym Environments for Robotics) enables users to easily define new tasks, switch from one sensor to another,
and switch from simulation to reality with a single line of code by being invariant to the physics engine.
EAGERx explicitly addresses the differences in learning between simulation and reality,
with essential features for roboticists such as a safety layer, signal delay simulation, and controller switching for resets.
A single RL pipeline that works with both the simulated and real robots eliminates the chance for mismatches between the simulation and reality implementation.
The defined task follows the OpenAI Gym interface, so one can plug in algorithms from established RL libraries
(e.g., `Stable-baselines3 <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3>`_ ) to solve the task afterward, again minimizing implementation errors.

    Example
    =================

Installation
============

You can do a minimal installation of ``EAGERx`` with:

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install eagerx

.. note::
    EAGERx depends on a minimal ROS installation. Fortunately, you **can** use eagerx anywhere as you would any python package,
    so it does **not** impose a ROS package structure on your project.
    See `here <ROS_>`_ for installation instructions.

Extras: GUI
---------------------

To install the whole set of features, you will need additional packages.
You can install everything by running:

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install eagerx-gui

.. image:: docs/gifs/gui.GIF

Extras: training visualization
------------------------------

In robotics it is crucial to monitor the robot's behavior during the learning process.
Luckily, inter-node communication within EAGERx can always be listened to externally, so that any relevant information stream can be trivially monitored on-demand (e.g. with ``rqt_plot``).

.. note::
    ``rqt_plot`` is included in the ``desktop`` or ``desktop-full`` ROS installation. See `here <ROS_>`_ for installation instructions.

Dependencies
============
Below you find instructions for installing dependencies required for EAGERx.

ROS
---------------------

See the `ROS Installation Options <https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, or do the following.
By replacing ``<DISTRO>`` with the supported ROS distributions (``noetic``, ``melodic``),
and ``<PACKAGE>`` with the installation type (``ros-base``, ``desktop``, ``desktop-full``),
a minimal ros installation can be installed with:

.. code:: shell

    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
    sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ros-<DISTRO>-<PACKAGE>
    sudo apt-get install ros-<DISTRO>-cv-bridge

Make sure to source ``/opt/ros/<DISTRO>/setup.bash`` in the environment where you intend to ``eagerx`` in.
It can be convenient to automatically source this script every time a new shell is launched.
These commands will do that for you if you:

.. code:: shell

      echo "source /opt/ros/<DISTRO>/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
      source ~/.bashrc

In case you make use of a virtual environment, move to the directory containing the ``.venv`` and
add ``source /opt/ros/<DISTRO>/setup.bash`` to the activation script before activating the environment with
this line:

.. code:: shell

      echo "source /opt/ros/<DISTRO>/setup.bash" >> .venv/bin/activate
