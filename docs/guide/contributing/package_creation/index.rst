******************
Creating a Package
******************

In this section we will describe how to create an EAGERx package, in this case the eagerx_ode package.
This package will contain the OdeBridge for simulating systems based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
Since the OdeBridge will be a generic bridge that can be useful for others, we will create a public repository for the OdeBridge.

Template
########

We will start by creating a new repository for this Python package, using `the template that is available here <https://github.com/eager-dev/eagerx_template>`_.

As you can see, this template repository already contains some folders and files.
