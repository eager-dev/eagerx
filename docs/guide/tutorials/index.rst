=========

A set of tutorials is created to showcase some of the key features of EAGERx and to guide users through the process of using EAGERx for robot learning tasks.
Most of them are available in the form of Google Colabs in the `eagerx_tutorials package <https://github.com/eager-dev/eagerx_tutorials>`_.
We will briefly introduce these tutorials in the following sections.
Furthermore, a tutorial on how to visualize training using EAGERx is available.
Finally, an advanced tutorial is available that covers a full example workflow of setting up robotic reinforcement learning experiments with EAGERx.
